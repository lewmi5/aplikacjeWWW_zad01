Instead, SQL is an international standard for managing and querying relational databases, defined and maintained by standardization bodies such as: . • ISO (International Organization for Standardization) • ANSI (American National Standards Institute) . While there isn’t a single “official SQL website,” you can refer to the ISO website for details on the SQL standard. For example, ISO/IEC 9075 is the standard that covers SQL. You can explore more about it here: . • ISO SQL Standard Information: ISO/IEC 9075 . Additionally, many database systems (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database) implement SQL according to this standard and have their own extensive documentation that explains SQL as it applies to their systems. If you’re looking for educational resources or documentation on SQL itself, you might consider the following: . • PostgreSQL Documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/ • MySQL Documentation: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ • Microsoft SQL Server Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ • Oracle SQL Documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/ .

    "title": "Static typing",
    "content": "SQL has a type system, but whether it is considered “statically typed” can depend on context and the specific SQL database system. Here are some key points: . | Table Definitions: When you define a table in SQL, you specify a data type for each column. For example, in a table creation statement, you might define a column as INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc. This means that the structure (or schema) of your data is defined up front, similar to static typing in programming languages. | Compile-Time Checks: Many SQL databases perform type checking when you compile or execute SQL statements. For example, if you try to insert a string into an INT column, the database will typically raise an error before the data is stored. This is analogous to compile-time type checking found in statically typed languages. | Expression Evaluations: SQL expressions also use the type system for evaluation. For instance, when performing arithmetic operations, the types of the operands are checked, and the result is computed based on those types. Some SQL dialects enforce strict type rules for expressions, while others may include implicit type conversions. | SQL Dialects and Variability: Different SQL databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.) may handle type checking and type coercion differently. Some may be stricter and enforce types more rigidly at query compilation, while others may allow more flexibility with implicit casting. This variability means that the experience can sometimes seem dynamic, even though the table definitions are statically declared. | Conclusion: In summary, SQL is typically considered statically typed in the sense that the schema (and thus the types of data) is defined upfront and checked when queries execute. However, the degree to which strict type enforcement occurs can vary between systems, and some features (like implicit type conversion) might give the impression of dynamic typing in certain contexts. | . So, while SQL is fundamentally statically typed in its definition and schema enforcement, the broader context of SQL systems sometimes exhibits behaviors that might seem less strictly static when compared to some strongly statically typed programming languages.

In Fortran, you typically declare the type of each variable explicitly. For example: . INTEGER :: i REAL :: x DOUBLE PRECISION :: y . Unless you specify otherwise, Fortran also applies implicit typing rules (based on variable names), which means that variables starting with certain letters (by default I-N) are assumed to be of type INTEGER and others as REAL. However, it’s a common best practice to disable this implicit behavior by including the statement “IMPLICIT NONE” at the beginning of your program or subroutine. This requires you to explicitly declare every variable, further reinforcing the static type system: . PROGRAM Example IMPLICIT NONE INTEGER :: count REAL :: value count = 5 value = 3.14 PRINT *, \"Count = \", count, \" Value = \", value END PROGRAM Example . In summary, Fortran’s type system is static because types are known and checked at compile time rather than being determined dynamically during execution. ",

It uses the BST property to decide whether to continue searching to the left or right. If the node with the given value is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns null. | . | Usage Example: . | A new BST is created. | Values are inserted into the BST. | The algorithm then searches for a value (in this case, 60) and prints whether the value was found. | . | .

    "content": "SQL’s type system can be a bit nuanced and depends on the context and the specific SQL dialect or database management system (DBMS) in use. Here are some key points to consider: . | Column Types in SQL: Standard SQL requires that each column in a table be declared with a data type (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE). This design implies that SQL is statically typed in the sense that the schema is defined with explicit types and they guide how data is stored, compared, and manipulated. | Compile‑time vs. Run‑time Type Checking: . | In many compiled or interpreted SQL environments (for example, when running queries against systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server), the DBMS checks the compatibility of data types during query parsing or planning. This means that many type mismatches are caught before the query actually runs, which is a property of static typing. | However, some SQL systems perform type checks or coercions at runtime, and certain operations can involve implicit type conversion. This behavior may give the impression of more dynamic type handling. | . | Variations Among Implementations: . | Strictly Statically Typed Systems: Many mainstream relational databases enforce strict type checking and will reject data that does not conform to the declared type. They also enforce type compatibility rules when performing operations on column values. | Systems with Dynamic Typing Aspects: Some databases, notably SQLite, use a concept called “type affinity.” In SQLite, you still define a column with a suggested type, but the engine is more permissive and may store a value of a different type than the declared type. This behavior resembles dynamic typing in some respects, although many SQL language constructs still treat types in a mostly static way. | . | Summary: . | In the traditional SQL sense, SQL is considered to be statically typed because schemas require explicit type definitions and many systems enforce type rules during query planning. | However, behaviors such as implicit type conversion and, in some cases (like SQLite), more relaxed type affinity rules, introduce elements that can seem dynamically typed. | . | . So, while the SQL standard and many common relational databases follow a statically typed architecture, there are notable exceptions and behaviors that can blur this distinction depending on the system you are using.

For example: . CREATE TABLE bst ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value INTEGER NOT NULL, left_id INTEGER, right_id INTEGER, CONSTRAINT fk_left FOREIGN KEY (left_id) REFERENCES bst(id), CONSTRAINT fk_right FOREIGN KEY (right_id) REFERENCES bst(id) ); . To find a given search value in the binary search tree using a recursive algorithm in SQL, you can use a recursive common table expression (CTE). Below is an example query. In this example, we assume: . | The root node’s id is known (for example, 1). | The search value is provided via a parameter (for example, @search_value). | . WITH RECURSIVE search_tree AS ( -- Start with the root node; adjust the id if your root is different.

How It Works . | Anchor member: The CTE starts with the root node (where id = 1). Adjust this if your root’s id differs. | Recursive member: For each node in the current result set (search_tree), we join back to the bst table. | If the current node’s value is greater than the search value, the join condition looks for a match on the left child (left_id). | If the current node’s value is less than the search value, it looks for a match on the right child (right_id). | . | Final selection: The final SELECT statement picks the record(s) where the value equals the @search_value. If the value exists in the tree, it will be returned; otherwise, the query returns no rows. | . Notes . | Replace @search_value with the actual search number or bind it as a parameter from your application. | Ensure your SQL dialect supports recursive CTEs (most modern RDBMSs like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite do). | This algorithm assumes that every value in the BST is unique. If duplicates are allowed, you might need to adjust the logic accordingly. | .

    "content": "Below is one way to design an algorithm in Scratch that implements a search for a value in a binary search tree. In this example, we assume that your binary search tree is represented by lists (arrays) that store node information. One common approach is to represent each node as a “record” (using parallel lists or a list of lists) containing the following properties: . • Value (the node’s number or data) • Left child pointer (e.g., the index of the left child node in the list, or −1/0 if none) • Right child pointer (similar to left child) . For the purposes of this algorithm, we assume you have these variables or lists set up: . | A list called “nodes” where each item is a node record. (In Scratch, you could simulate a record using multiple lists that use the same index for corresponding properties. For example, “node_values,” “left_child,” and “right_child.”) | A variable called “target” (the value you are searching for). | A variable called “current” which will hold the current node’s index. | A special value (for example, -1) to signal “no child.” | . Below is an explanation using the parallel lists approach. Adjust according to your tree structure: . ────────────────────────────── Assumptions (setup): ────────────────────────────── Assume the following lists exist: . | node_values | left_child | right_child | . Each node is stored at some index i in these lists: . | The value is at node_values[i]. | The index of the left child is at left_child[i], or -1 if none. | The index of the right child is at right_child[i], or -1 if none. | . Assume the root node is at index 1. ────────────────────────────── Algorithm Overview: ────────────────────────────── We repeat the following until we either find the target or hit a leaf node: . | Start at the root (set current index to 1). | Compare target with node_values[current]. a. If equal, the target is found. b. If target &lt; node_values[current], then move to the left child using left_child[current]. c. If target &gt; node_values[current], then move to the right child using right_child[current]. | If at any point current becomes -1, then the target is not found. | . ────────────────────────────── The Scratch Blocks Algorithm: ────────────────────────────── Below is a step-by-step description that you can implement with Scratch blocks.
