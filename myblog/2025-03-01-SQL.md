# Official website
 SQL (Structured Query Language) is not a product with an official website like a specific software application. Instead, SQL is an international standard for managing and querying relational databases, defined and maintained by standardization bodies such as:

• ISO (International Organization for Standardization)  
• ANSI (American National Standards Institute)

While there isn’t a single "official SQL website," you can refer to the ISO website for details on the SQL standard. For example, ISO/IEC 9075 is the standard that covers SQL. You can explore more about it here:

• ISO SQL Standard Information: [ISO/IEC 9075](https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html)

Additionally, many database systems (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database) implement SQL according to this standard and have their own extensive documentation that explains SQL as it applies to their systems.

If you’re looking for educational resources or documentation on SQL itself, you might consider the following:

• PostgreSQL Documentation: [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)  
• MySQL Documentation: [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)  
• Microsoft SQL Server Documentation: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/)  
• Oracle SQL Documentation: [https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/)

Each of these resources offers detailed information, tutorials, and references for learning SQL as implemented in their respective systems.
# Static typing
 SQL has a type system, but whether it is considered "statically typed" can depend on context and the specific SQL database system.

Here are some key points:

1. Table Definitions:  
   When you define a table in SQL, you specify a data type for each column. For example, in a table creation statement, you might define a column as INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc. This means that the structure (or schema) of your data is defined up front, similar to static typing in programming languages.

2. Compile-Time Checks:  
   Many SQL databases perform type checking when you compile or execute SQL statements. For example, if you try to insert a string into an INT column, the database will typically raise an error before the data is stored. This is analogous to compile-time type checking found in statically typed languages.

3. Expression Evaluations:  
   SQL expressions also use the type system for evaluation. For instance, when performing arithmetic operations, the types of the operands are checked, and the result is computed based on those types. Some SQL dialects enforce strict type rules for expressions, while others may include implicit type conversions.

4. SQL Dialects and Variability:  
   Different SQL databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.) may handle type checking and type coercion differently. Some may be stricter and enforce types more rigidly at query compilation, while others may allow more flexibility with implicit casting. This variability means that the experience can sometimes seem dynamic, even though the table definitions are statically declared.

5. Conclusion:  
   In summary, SQL is typically considered statically typed in the sense that the schema (and thus the types of data) is defined upfront and checked when queries execute. However, the degree to which strict type enforcement occurs can vary between systems, and some features (like implicit type conversion) might give the impression of dynamic typing in certain contexts.

So, while SQL is fundamentally statically typed in its definition and schema enforcement, the broader context of SQL systems sometimes exhibits behaviors that might seem less strictly static when compared to some strongly statically typed programming languages.
