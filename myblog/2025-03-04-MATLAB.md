# Static typing
 MATLAB is a dynamically typed language. This means that:

- **No Static Type Declaration:** You don't need to declare the data type of a variable before using it. You simply assign a value, and MATLAB determines the variable's type at runtime.
  
- **Runtime Type Resolution:** The type of a variable is determined as the program runs, and the type can even change if you later assign a value of a different type to the same variable.
  
- **Flexibility with Variables:** This dynamic typing allows for greater flexibility in coding, but it also means that some type-related errors may only be caught during execution rather than at compile-time.

In summary, MATLAB does not perform static type checking but relies on dynamic type determination during program execution.
# Example code
 Below is one way to implement a binary search tree (BST) lookup function in MATLAB. In this example:

• A BST node is represented as a structure with fields:
  - value: The value stored in the node.
  - left: A pointer (structure) to the left child (or [] if none).
  - right: A pointer (structure) to the right child (or [] if none).

• The function bst_find recursively traverses the BST looking for the given value. If the value is found, the function returns the node (i.e., the structure). If not found, it returns an empty array ([]).

Below is the complete MATLAB code:

---

```matlab
function node = bst_find(root, target)
% bst_find searches for target value in a binary search tree.
%
% Parameters:
%   root   - The root node of the BST (a structure with fields 'value', 'left', 'right').
%   target - The value you want to search for.
%
% Returns:
%   node - The node containing the target value, or [] if not found.

    if isempty(root)
        % Base case: tree is empty – not found.
        node = [];
        return;
    end
    
    if target == root.value
        % Found the target value at the current node.
        node = root;
        return;
    elseif target < root.value
        % If the target is less than the current node,
        % search in the left subtree.
        node = bst_find(root.left, target);
    else
        % Otherwise, search in the right subtree.
        node = bst_find(root.right, target);
    end

end
```

### Example Usage

Here’s how you might build a sample binary search tree and then search for a value using the above function.

```matlab
% Create nodes for the BST
node7 = struct('value', 70, 'left', [], 'right', []);
node6 = struct('value', 30, 'left', [], 'right', []);
node5 = struct('value', 100, 'left', [], 'right', []);
node4 = struct('value', 10, 'left', [], 'right', []);
node3 = struct('value', 50, 'left', node6, 'right', node7);
node2 = struct('value', 25, 'left', node4, 'right', node5);
node1 = struct('value', 40, 'left', node2, 'right', node3);
% node1 is the root of the BST.

% Search for a value
targetValue = 10;
result = bst_find(node1, targetValue);

if isempty(result)
    fprintf('Value %d not found in the BST.\n', targetValue);
else
    fprintf('Value %d found in the BST.\n', result.value);
end
```

### How the Code Works

1. The function `bst_find` is defined to search a BST recursively.
2. When the function is called:
   - If the current node (`root`) is empty, it returns `[]` (indicating that the target is not found).
   - If the value in the current node matches the target, it returns the node.
   - Otherwise, it moves to the left subtree if the target is smaller than the current node's value or to the right subtree if larger.
3. An example BST is created using MATLAB structures and then search is performed on it.

This algorithm takes advantage of the BST property (left child < parent < right child) to efficiently search for a value.
