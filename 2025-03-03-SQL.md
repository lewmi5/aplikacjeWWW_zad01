# Official website
 SQL (Structured Query Language) is not managed or owned by a single organization, so there isn’t a singular "official website of SQL." Instead, SQL is a standardized language governed by:

• ANSI (American National Standards Institute) – ANSI is responsible for the SQL standard in the United States. You can find more information about ANSI standards at the ANSI website: [ANSI Webstore](https://webstore.ansi.org/).

• ISO (International Organization for Standardization) – ISO publishes the international standards for SQL (e.g., ISO/IEC 9075). You can browse ISO standards on their website: [ISO Website](https://www.iso.org/).

For general reference and an overview of SQL, the Wikipedia page can also serve as a useful resource: [SQL on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).

If you are looking for documentation or further information on a particular SQL dialect (such as T-SQL for Microsoft SQL Server, PL/SQL for Oracle, or PostgreSQL’s SQL language), it would be best to visit the official website of the respective vendor or community.
# Static typing
 SQL's type system can be a bit nuanced and depends on the context and the specific SQL dialect or database management system (DBMS) in use. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Column Types in SQL:  
   Standard SQL requires that each column in a table be declared with a data type (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE). This design implies that SQL is statically typed in the sense that the schema is defined with explicit types and they guide how data is stored, compared, and manipulated.

2. Compile‑time vs. Run‑time Type Checking:  
   - In many compiled or interpreted SQL environments (for example, when running queries against systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server), the DBMS checks the compatibility of data types during query parsing or planning. This means that many type mismatches are caught before the query actually runs, which is a property of static typing.
   - However, some SQL systems perform type checks or coercions at runtime, and certain operations can involve implicit type conversion. This behavior may give the impression of more dynamic type handling.

3. Variations Among Implementations:  
   - **Strictly Statically Typed Systems:** Many mainstream relational databases enforce strict type checking and will reject data that does not conform to the declared type. They also enforce type compatibility rules when performing operations on column values.
   - **Systems with Dynamic Typing Aspects:** Some databases, notably SQLite, use a concept called "type affinity." In SQLite, you still define a column with a suggested type, but the engine is more permissive and may store a value of a different type than the declared type. This behavior resembles dynamic typing in some respects, although many SQL language constructs still treat types in a mostly static way.

4. Summary:  
   - In the traditional SQL sense, SQL is considered to be statically typed because schemas require explicit type definitions and many systems enforce type rules during query planning.
   - However, behaviors such as implicit type conversion and, in some cases (like SQLite), more relaxed type affinity rules, introduce elements that can seem dynamically typed.

So, while the SQL standard and many common relational databases follow a statically typed architecture, there are notable exceptions and behaviors that can blur this distinction depending on the system you are using.
# Example code
 Assume you have a table representing your binary search tree structured like this:

- id: Unique identifier for the node.
- value: The actual value stored in the node.
- left_id: References the left child node (or is NULL if none).
- right_id: References the right child node (or is NULL if none).

For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bst (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    value INTEGER NOT NULL,
    left_id INTEGER,
    right_id INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT fk_left FOREIGN KEY (left_id) REFERENCES bst(id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_right FOREIGN KEY (right_id) REFERENCES bst(id)
);
```

To find a given search value in the binary search tree using a recursive algorithm in SQL, you can use a recursive common table expression (CTE).

Below is an example query. In this example, we assume:
- The root node's id is known (for example, 1).
- The search value is provided via a parameter (for example, @search_value).

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE search_tree AS (
    -- Start with the root node; adjust the id if your root is different.
    SELECT 
        id, 
        value,
        left_id, 
        right_id
    FROM bst
    WHERE id = 1  -- assuming root node id is 1

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursively traverse the tree.
    SELECT 
        bst.id, 
        bst.value,
        bst.left_id,
        bst.right_id
    FROM bst
    JOIN search_tree st ON (
            -- Decide which child to join on depending on the search value.
            (st.value > @search_value AND bst.id = st.left_id) OR 
            (st.value < @search_value AND bst.id = st.right_id)
        )
)
SELECT *
FROM search_tree
WHERE value = @search_value;
```

### How It Works

1. **Anchor member:**  
   The CTE starts with the root node (where `id = 1`). Adjust this if your root's id differs.

2. **Recursive member:**  
   For each node in the current result set (`search_tree`), we join back to the `bst` table.  
   - If the current node’s value is greater than the search value, the join condition looks for a match on the left child (`left_id`).  
   - If the current node’s value is less than the search value, it looks for a match on the right child (`right_id`).

3. **Final selection:**  
   The final SELECT statement picks the record(s) where the `value` equals the `@search_value`.  
   If the value exists in the tree, it will be returned; otherwise, the query returns no rows.

### Notes

- Replace `@search_value` with the actual search number or bind it as a parameter from your application.
- Ensure your SQL dialect supports recursive CTEs (most modern RDBMSs like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite do).
- This algorithm assumes that every value in the BST is unique. If duplicates are allowed, you might need to adjust the logic accordingly.

This algorithm mimics the binary-search process by traversing only the branch that could contain the value based on comparisons at each node.
