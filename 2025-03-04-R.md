# Static typing
 R is not statically typed; it is dynamically typed. In R, types are checked at runtime rather than during the compilation process. This means:

- You can assign any type of value to a variable without declaring its data type beforehand.
- Type errors will be caught when the code is executed rather than before the code is run.

For example, you can assign a numeric value to a variable one moment and then assign a character string to the same variable later without encountering a type declaration error. This flexibility is a characteristic of dynamically typed languages like R.
# Example code
 Below is an example of how you can implement a binary search tree (BST) search in R. In this example, we first define a simple BST structure using lists (each node is a list with a value, a left child, and a right child). Then we create a recursive function, findInBST, which searches for a given target value within the tree.

```r
# Define a function to create a new BST node
newNode <- function(value, left = NULL, right = NULL) {
  list(value = value, left = left, right = right)
}

# Recursive function to search for a value in the BST.
# Returns the node if found, or NULL if not found.
findInBST <- function(root, target) {
  # if the tree is empty, return NULL
  if (is.null(root)) {
    return(NULL)
  }
  
  # if the current node's value matches the target, return the node
  if (root$value == target) {
    return(root)
  }
  
  # if target is smaller than node's value, search the left subtree
  if (target < root$value) {
    return(findInBST(root$left, target))
  } else {
    # if target is larger than node's value, search the right subtree
    return(findInBST(root$right, target))
  }
}

# Example usage:

# Manually constructing a binary search tree:
#         8
#        / \
#       3   10
#      / \    \
#     1   6    14
#         / \ 
#        4   7

node1 <- newNode(1)
node4 <- newNode(4)
node7 <- newNode(7)
node6 <- newNode(6, left = node4, right = node7)
node3 <- newNode(3, left = node1, right = node6)
node14 <- newNode(14)
node10 <- newNode(10, right = node14)
root <- newNode(8, left = node3, right = node10)

# Searching for a value
targetValue <- 7
result <- findInBST(root, targetValue)

if (!is.null(result)) {
  cat("Found:", result$value, "\n")
} else {
  cat("Value", targetValue, "not found in the BST.\n")
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Node Structure**:  
   We create a node as a list that holds the current `value` and pointers (`left` and `right`) to its children. The helper function `newNode` makes node creation concise.

2. **Search Function (`findInBST`)**:  
   - It first checks if the current node (`root`) is `NULL`. If yes, it returns `NULL` meaning the target is not found.
   - If the node's value equals the target, it returns the current node.
   - If the target is less than the node's value, the function recursively searches the left subtree.
   - Otherwise, it recursively searches the right subtree.

3. **Example Tree and Usage**:  
   We create a simple BST manually and demonstrate how to search for a value, printing the result.

This code can be run directly in an R environment, and you can modify it further if needed.
