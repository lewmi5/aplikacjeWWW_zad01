# Official website
 The official resources for Visual Basic are hosted by Microsoft. You can start with the Visual Basic section on Microsoft's .NET documentation:

[Visual Basic .NET Documentation on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/)

This site provides comprehensive official information, tutorials, and references for Visual Basic.
# Static typing
 The answer depends on which version of Visual Basic you are referring to:

1. Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET):  
   VB.NET is generally considered a statically typed language. This means that each variable must have a type that is determined at compile time. However, by default, VB.NET allows some flexibility due to features such as type inference (introduced in later versions) and the ability to disable strict type checking by using the "Option Strict Off" directive. When "Option Strict" is on—which is recommended for safer, more predictable code—the type of every variable is known at compile time, and implicit data type conversions are limited to those that are safe, making the language statically typed.

2. Earlier Versions of Visual Basic (such as VB6):  
   Older versions of Visual Basic (like VB6) are not strictly statically typed. They were designed to be more flexible and provide a degree of dynamic typing. For example, variables were often declared as type Variant, which allowed them to hold any type of data at runtime. This made earlier Visual Basic versions less strictly statically typed compared to VB.NET.

In summary:  
- Visual Basic .NET (with Option Strict On) is a statically typed language.  
- Older versions of Visual Basic were more dynamically typed.
# Example code
 Below is an example of a Visual Basic algorithm to search for a specific value within a binary search tree. In this example, we define a simple Binary Search Tree node class, then implement a recursive method to search for the value. You can paste this code into a Visual Basic project (such as a Console Application) and run it.

```vb
Module Module1

    ' Class representing a node in the binary search tree.
    Public Class TreeNode
        Public Property Value As Integer
        Public Property Left As TreeNode
        Public Property Right As TreeNode

        ' Constructor to initialize the node with a value.
        Public Sub New(ByVal value As Integer)
            Me.Value = value
            Me.Left = Nothing
            Me.Right = Nothing
        End Sub
    End Class

    ' Function to search for a value in the binary search tree.
    Public Function SearchBST(ByVal root As TreeNode, ByVal target As Integer) As Boolean
        ' If the current node is null, then the target is not found.
        If root Is Nothing Then
            Return False
        End If

        ' Check if the current node matches the target.
        If root.Value = target Then
            Return True
        End If

        ' If the target is less than the current node's value, search in the left subtree.
        If target < root.Value Then
            Return SearchBST(root.Left, target)
        Else
            ' Otherwise, search in the right subtree.
            Return SearchBST(root.Right, target)
        End If
    End Function

    ' A helper function to insert a new value into the BST.
    Public Function InsertBST(ByVal root As TreeNode, ByVal value As Integer) As TreeNode
        If root Is Nothing Then
            Return New TreeNode(value)
        ElseIf value < root.Value Then
            root.Left = InsertBST(root.Left, value)
        Else
            root.Right = InsertBST(root.Right, value)
        End If
        Return root
    End Function

    Sub Main()
        ' Create a binary search tree:
        Dim root As TreeNode = Nothing
        Dim values() As Integer = {50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80}

        ' Insert values into the BST.
        For Each val As Integer In values
            root = InsertBST(root, val)
        Next

        ' Define a target value to search for.
        Dim targetValue As Integer = 60

        ' Search the BST for the target value.
        Dim found As Boolean = SearchBST(root, targetValue)

        ' Display the result.
        If found Then
            Console.WriteLine("Value " & targetValue & " found in the binary search tree.")
        Else
            Console.WriteLine("Value " & targetValue & " not found in the binary search tree.")
        End If

        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...")
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Sub

End Module
```

### Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class:**  
   This class holds the value and pointers to the left and right children.

2. **SearchBST Function:**  
   This function takes the tree root and the target value as parameters.  
   - It first checks if the current node is `Nothing` (indicating that the tree or subtree is empty) and returns `False`.
   - It then compares the current node's value with the target.  
   - If the current node's value is greater than the target, the function calls itself recursively on the left subtree; otherwise, it searches the right subtree.

3. **InsertBST Function:**  
   This helper function is used to build the tree by recursively finding the correct location to insert a new value.

4. **Main Subroutine:**  
   The `Main` routine populates the binary search tree with example values and then searches for a specific target value. The result is printed to the console.

You can modify the example values and target value as needed. This implementation assumes a BST where duplicate values are not allowed.
